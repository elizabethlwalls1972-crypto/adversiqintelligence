            <p>At ADVERSIQ Intelligence, we believe that Artificial Intelligence holds immense potential to unlock regional economic opportunities and foster inclusive, sustainable development globally. However, we recognize that this power must be wielded with profound responsibility. Our ADVERSIQ platform is being built upon a foundation of strong ethical principles and robust data governance practices. We are committed to ensuring our technology serves humanity, respects individual rights, and promotes equitable outcomes.</p>
            <p className="mt-2">This framework outlines our guiding principles for the ethical development and deployment of AI and the responsible management of data within the ADVERSIQ ecosystem. It is a living document and will evolve as AI technologies and global best practices advance.</p>

            <p><strong className="text-bw-gold/80">Human-Centricity & Beneficial Purpose:</strong> The primary objective of ADVERSIQ is to augment human intelligence and support decisions that lead to positive socio-economic outcomes, particularly for underserved regional communities. We prioritize applications of AI that aim to alleviate poverty, enhance inclusive growth, promote environmental sustainability, and improve governance, in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
            <p className="mt-2"><strong className="text-bw-gold/80">Fairness & Non-Discrimination (Bias Mitigation):</strong> We acknowledge the potential for biases in data and algorithms. BWGA is committed to proactively identifying and mitigating such biases throughout the AI lifecycle - from data collection and model training to deployment and monitoring.</p>
            <p className="mt-2"><strong className="text-bw-gold/80">Transparency & Explainability (Appropriate to Context):</strong> While the deepest algorithmic complexities of our proprietary ADVERSIQ engine may remain trade secrets, we are committed to transparency regarding Data Sourcing, Methodological Approach (High-Level), and the Limitations of AI.</p>
            <p className="mt-2"><strong className="text-bw-gold/80">Accountability & Autonomous Oversight:</strong> ADVERSIQ runs source provenance, formula checks, and audit trails before presenting strategic recommendations. User checkpoints are reserved for explicit requests and externally binding actions.</p>
            <p className="mt-2"><strong className="text-bw-gold/80">Security & Safety:</strong> We are committed to developing AI systems that are robust, secure, and operate safely within their intended parameters, minimizing risks of unintended consequences.</p>

          <p><strong className="text-white">Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency:</strong> ADVERSIQ will process data in compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including principles aligned with GDPR and other relevant national frameworks.</p>
          <p><strong className="text-white">Data Minimization & Purpose Limitation:</strong> We strive to collect and process only the data necessary for the specific, legitimate purposes of regional economic analysis, investment matchmaking, and providing strategic insights. Primarily, ADVERSIQ leverages publicly available data, official government statistics, and third-party licensed data.</p>
          <p><strong className="text-white">Confidentiality & Security:</strong> Confidential information shared with ADVERSIQ by clients or partners will be protected through appropriate technical and organizational security measures and governed by strict Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs).</p>
          <p><strong className="text-white">Consent (Where Applicable):</strong> While ADVERSIQ primarily deals with aggregated or publicly available data, should any personal data be involved, its processing will be subject to explicit consent and clear information regarding its use.</p>

          <p><strong className="text-white block mb-1">1. Intelligence Layer, Not a CRM:</strong> The ADVERSIQ is an "Early-Stage Intelligence Layer" designed to operate upstream of your CRM, ERP, or Investment Committee. It provides the initial "Go/No-Go" signals and strategic frameworks for regional engagement.</p>
          <p><strong className="text-white block mb-1">2. Decision Support, Not Authority:</strong> The system provides probabilistic insights and data-driven recommendations. Users, especially at 'Novice' levels, should verify critical outputs with 'Expert' domain holders. Final strategic decisions remain your sole responsibility.</p>
          <p><strong className="text-white block mb-1">3. Data Sovereignty & Isolation:</strong> The system adheres to strict GDPR and local data sovereignty protocols. Your custom operational data and strategic intents are cryptographically isolated and are never used to train public models.</p>
          <p><strong className="text-white block mb-1">4. Financial & Operational Simulations:</strong> All financial models (ROI, IRR, etc.) are simulations based on the data you provide and historical benchmarks. They are not to be construed as financial advice. The accuracy of these models scales dynamically with the granularity of your inputs.</p>
          <p><strong className="text-white block mb-1">5. Predictive Limits:</strong> Our proprietary dataset spans ~1925-2025, enabling the identification of long-wave economic cycles and historical failure patterns. However, unforeseen "black swan" events can impact predictive accuracy.</p>
          <p><strong className="text-white block mb-1">6. AI Agent Validation:</strong> Semi-autonomous AI agents construct intelligence dossiers within strict ethical and logical guardrails. It is the user's responsibility to validate critical data points before making final commitments.</p>
          <p><strong className="text-white block mb-1">7. No Guarantees & User Responsibility:</strong> While great effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the data and analyses, this system is a decision-support tool, not a final say. The onus is on the user to verify all information before making financial or strategic commitments. We welcome feedback to help a better service.</p>
          <p><strong className="text-white block mb-1">8. Logical Integrity Protocol:</strong> The Neuro-Symbolic core enforces logical consistency. The system will flag or halt processes if user inputs fundamentally contradict established economic principles or fail data integrity checks.</p>
