/**
 * COGNITIVE REASONING ENGINE
 * 
 * Models 12 human cognitive processes that standard AI lacks when solving
 * economic, partnership, and investment problems.
 * 
 * THE HUMAN BRAIN INSIGHT:
 * When humans solve complex economic problems, they don't just run formulas.
 * They use intuition, emotional intelligence, pattern-completion, analogical
 * reasoning, perspective-taking, and — critically — they strip problems back
 * to their core truth. At the centre of every complicated economic matter is
 * a simple problem with a simple answer. Humans complicate it with politics,
 * ego, fear, and bureaucracy. This engine strips that away.
 * 
 * WHAT AI TYPICALLY MISSES:
 * 1. Gut instinct (fast heuristic pattern matching from sparse signals)
 * 2. Emotional read (stakeholder fear/greed/ego detection)
 * 3. Analogical transfer (solving by mapping to a completely different domain)
 * 4. Perspective rotation (seeing through each party's eyes simultaneously)
 * 5. Core truth extraction (stripping complexity to find the real problem)
 * 6. Sunk cost recognition (what they should abandon but won't)
 * 7. Trust calibration (who is actually trustworthy vs who just looks it)
 * 8. Temporal patience modelling (short-term pain for long-term gain)
 * 9. Relationship dynamics (power, dependency, leverage, chemistry)
 * 10. Creative recombination (solutions from combining unrelated ideas)
 * 11. Failure pre-mortem (imagine you failed — why did you fail?)
 * 12. The "obvious" solution nobody tried (simplest path bias override)
